        <p class = "description">"Hi, I'm Nandhini Sridhar, and this is my digital art portfolio. I'm an incoming freshman at the University of California, Davis and am a Computer Science and Engineering major. 

            â€‹
            
            I have always loved art, and as my love and passion for technology grew through the years, so did my affinity for digital art. All the work you see in this portfolio was made digitally, although I have art in classical mediums I can provide upon request. Thanks, and I hope you enjoyed looking through my work!"</p>
